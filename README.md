# YouCast

## 🌟 Why YouCast Exists

My younger sister loves listening to podcasts and music on YouTube, but the constant ads and the need to keep the screen on were always a hassle. She wanted an app that could turn YouTube into a seamless podcast experience, letting her stream and download audio without interruptions. 

Inspired by her request and my passion for app development, I decided to create **YouCast**—an app that transforms YouTube into a personalized podcast library.
